            <center>JDM-exclusive Skyline GT-Rs, the R35 Nissan GT-R was designed for the global market from its launch in 2007. It is technically a different model but continues the legacy of the GT-R name. 
            Key differences from JDM Skylines
            Engine: Replaced the RB26DETT inline-six with a new 3.8L twin-turbo V6 engine.
            Transmission: Swapped the manual transmission for a six-speed dual-clutch automatic.
            Global availability: Was officially sold in the U.S. and other markets, unlike its predecessors.
            Discontinuation: Production of the R35 GT-R ended in August 2025.
